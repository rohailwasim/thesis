              <p className="text-gray-700">
                As part of my dissertation for my MSc Human-Centered Interactive Technologies, this study explores how
                digital interface distractions affect decision-making and task performance, particularly for individuals
                with ADHD. The findings will help inform inclusive interface design principles to make digital
                environments more ADHD-friendly.

                <li>You will complete this study online through a web-based platform hosted online.</li>
                <li>
                  The study consists of:

                    <li>A Consent form</li>
                    <li>A short Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) screener (6 questions)</li>
                    <li>
                      Main Task: A simulated e-commerce shopping experience where you will be asked to find and add
                      laptops meeting specific criteria to a shopping cart.
                    </li>
                    <li>A final submission screen confirming your responses.</li>

                  of the study.
                </li>

                  No video or audio recording will take place. The system will only record interaction data such as:
